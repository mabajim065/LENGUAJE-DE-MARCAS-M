    Select the meals for names that contain 'obb'


      No worries, you've got this!

You're about to learn CSS Selectors! Selectors are how you pick which
element to apply styles to.


        Exhibit 1 - A CSS Rule

p {
   margin-bottom: 12px;
}

Here, the "p" is the selector (selects all <p> elements) and applies the
margin-bottom style.

To play, type in a CSS selector in the editor below to select the
correct items on the table.If you get it right, you'll advance to the
next level.

Hover over the items on the table to see their HTML markup.

      Attribute Wildcard Selector


    Select all elements with an attribute value that contains specific
    characters anywhere


[attribute*="value"]

A useful selector if you can identify a common pattern in things like
*class*, *href* or *src* attributes.


        Examples

*img[src*="/thumbnails/"]* selects all image elements that show images
from the "thumbnails" folder.
*[class*="heading"]* selects all elements with "heading" in their class,
like *class="main-heading"* and *class="sub-heading"*
